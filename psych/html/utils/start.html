		In order to get familiar with the possible ticket prices for your trip we will
		show you on the next screen 50 prices of potential tickets from different providers,
		one at a time.<br> At each ticket, press the spacebar or the 'Next' button to move to the next ticket.<br>
		After every 10 tickets we will ask you about your estimate of the average ticket price.
		<br><br>
		This will take about a minute.
		<br><br>
		At the end we will examine how well you learned the distribution of the possible prices for you trip to Canada.
