                <h3>Experiment Instructions</h3>
		<div class="cscroller">
                       	<p>
				Imagine you want to buy an airplane ticket for a trip to Canada. Different providers offer
				different deals for your trip but you want to find the cheapest ticket from all the offers.
				<br>
				And that’s exactly what you will be doing here.
				<br><br>
				The experiment is divided into four parts:
				<br><br>
				<b>First part: Training phase - Get familiar with possible ticket prices</b>
				<br>
				We will show you 50 ticket prices from different providers for your trip.<br>
        After every 10 tickets we will ask you about the avarage ticket price.
                       		<br><br>
				<b>Second part: Test phase - Choose best ticket out of 10 tickets</b>
				<br>
				In this part you have to choose the cheapest out of 10 tickets.<br>
				The tickets are shown sequentially, one at the time. Every time you will have to
				choose either to accept the ticket or to continue. The goal is to find the cheapest ticket.
				The better you choose the more money you will get.
				<br><br>
				<b>Third and fourth parts: Equivalent to the first and second parts but with different ticket prices</b>
				<br>
				We change the destination for your trip and therefore you will encounter slightly
				different ticket prices. The procedure remains the same as in the first and second part –
				after learning about potential ticket prices for your new trip you will have to select the
				cheapest ticket out of 10 tickets.
				<br><br>
				This study lasts at most 40 minutes and you will get $5.00 for participating. Further,
				you will get a bonus depending on your performance up to a maximum of $5.00.
				<br><br>
				You will get detailed instructions and a trial run during the study.
				<br><br>
				Please press continue to begin.
