		On the next screen you will be shown 50 consecutive sequences, each of 10 ticket prices, just as in the first of the experiment.
		<br><br>
		Your total amount of points will be increased according to the same rules as before:
		<ul style="margin:8px 0px">
			<li>Picking the <b>cheapest ticket</b> you will get <b>3 points</b></li>
			<li>Picking the <b>second cheapest ticket</b> you will get <b>2 point</b></li>
			<li>Picking the <b>third, forth or fifth cheapest ticket</b> you will get <b>1 point</b></li>
			<li><b>Otherwise</b> you will get <b>no points</b></li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		We remind you again that at the end your bonus will be proportional to your points, e.g. if you get all the points (300 points) you get $5.00, if you get half the points (75 points) you get $2.50.
