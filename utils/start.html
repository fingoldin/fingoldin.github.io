			Letâ€™s start with the training part!
			Imagine you plan a trip to Australia and you want to book an airplane ticket.
			To get an idea about the possible prices you first take an overview about the possible offers.
			<br><br>
			On the next screen we will show you 50 prices of tickets for your trip, one at a time, very
