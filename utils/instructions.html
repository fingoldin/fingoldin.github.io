                <h3>Experiment Instructions</h3>
		<div class="cscroller">
                       	<p>
				Imagine you want to buy an airplane ticket for a trip to Canada. Different providers offer
				different deals for your trip but you want to find the cheapest ticket from all the offers.
				<br>
				And that’s exactly what you will be doing here.
				<br><br>
				The experiment is divided into four parts:
				<br><br>
				<i>First part: Training phase - Get familiar with possible ticket prices</i>
				<br>
				We will show you 50 ticket prices from different providers for your trip. At the end of
				the training phase we will ask you about the distribution of the ticket prices.
                       		<br><br>
				<i>Second part: Test phase - Choose best ticket out of 10 tickets</i>
				<br>
				Now you have to choose a ticket.<br>
				We will show you ten tickets sequentially, one at the time. Every time you will have to
				choose either to accept the ticket or to continue. The goal is to find the cheapest ticket.
				According to your performance you are collecting points that will be turned into money
				reward at the end of the experiment.
				<br><br>
				<i>Third and fourth part: Equivalent to the first and second parts but with different ticket prices</i>
				<br>
				We change the destination for your trip and therefore you will encounter slightly
				different ticket prices. The procedure remains the same as in the first and second part –
				after learning about potential ticket prices for your new trip you will have to select the
				cheapest ticket out of ten tickets.
				<br><br>
				This study lasts at most 40 minutes and you will get $10.00 for participating. Further,
				you will get a bonus depending on your performance up to a maximum of $5.00.
				<br><br>
				You will get detailed instructions and a trial run during the study
				<br><br>
				Please press continue to begin.
