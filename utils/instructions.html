					Imagine that you want to buy an airplane ticket but you have different providers with
					different prices. The goal is to find the cheapest ticket but the difficulty is that the offers
					are presented one after the other with a delay period and every time you see an offer
					you have to decide either to take it or reject it.
					But once you have rejected an offer you cannot go back.
					<br><br>
					There will be two parts in this experiment: In the first part you learn about the possible
					prices for your ticket. In the second part 20 offers will be presented and you have to try
					to choose the best offer.
					<br><br>
					This study lasts at most 60 minutes. You will get 10 Dollars for participating on this
					study. Further, you will get a bonus depending on your performance up to a maximum of
					5 Dollars.
					<br><br>
					You will get detailed instructions and a trial run during the study.
					<br><br>
					Please press continue to begin.
