		Now it's time for the testing part!

		On the next screen, you will be shown one sequence of 10 ticket prices.
		Considering the ticket prices you saw before, you should try and find the cheapest ticket from each sequence. 
		<br><br>
		At each ticket price, you have the choice to buy it or look at the next one.
		However, you cannot go back to a ticket price that you already saw.
		Note: Pressing the spacebar will go to the next price, or will choose the current one if it is the last in the sequence.
		<br><br>
		NOTE: The following sequence is an example sequence, and while you should try to find the best price, your performance in this sequence does NOT matter.
