		Now the real sequences begin!

		On the next screen you will be shown 50 consecutive sequences, each of 10 ticket prices, just as you were just shown 1.
		<br><br>
		You will be awarded a bonus in money that depends on your performance in these next 50 sequences â€“ for picking the cheapest ticket you will get 2 points and for
                the second best 1 point, otherwise you will get no points. Your bonus will be proportional to your points.
