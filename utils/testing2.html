		Great !
		So far you have collected <div id="points-count" class="inline-div"></div> and you win <div id="dollars-count" class="inline-div"></div> dollars.
		<br><br>
		Let's try  again - there will be again 50 consecutive sequences,
		10 tickets each, with ticket prices as you encountered before.
		<br><br>
		Your total amount of points will be increased according to the same rules as before:
		<ul style="margin:8px 0px">
			<li>Picking the <b>cheapest ticket</b> you will get <b>3 points</b></li>
			<li>Picking the <b>second cheapest ticket</b> you will get <b>2 point</b></li>
			<li>Picking the <b>third, forth or fifth cheapest ticket</b> you will get <b>1 point</b></li>
			<li><b>Otherwise</b> you will get <b>no points</b></li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		We remind you again that at the end your bonus will be proportional to your points, so if you get all the remaing 150 points you get
		additional $2.00 (and $1.00 if you get 75 points).
